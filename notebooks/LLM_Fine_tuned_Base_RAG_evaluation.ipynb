untreated mental illness and substance misuse, while protective factors for suicide at this level include problem-solving and coping skills, positive self-esteem, and a sense of purpose in life.\\\\nRelationship-level risks\\\\ninclude family conflict, knowing someone who died by suicide (particularly a family members), and social isolation; protective factors include family connectedness and supportive friendships.\\\\nCommunity-level risks\\\\ninvolve community violence, historical trauma, and access to lethal means; and protective factors include access to behavioral health services, community or cultural beliefs that discourage suicide, and connectedness to community and social institutions.\\\\nSocietal-level risks\\\\ninclude stigma, racism, and discrimination,
