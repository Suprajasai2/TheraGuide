untreated mental illness and substance misuse, while protective factors for suicide at this level include problem-solving and coping skills, positive self-esteem, and a sense of purpose in life.\\\\nRelationship-level risks\\\\ninclude family conflict, knowing someone who died by suicide (particularly a family members), and social isolation; protective factors include family connectedness and supportive friendships.\\\\nCommunity-level risks\\\\ninvolve community violence, historical trauma, and access to lethal means; and protective factors include access to behavioral health services, community or cultural beliefs that discourage suicide, and connectedness to community and social institutions.\\\\nSocietal-level risks\\\\ninclude stigma, racism, and discrimination,

untreated mental illness and substance misuse, while protective factors for suicide at this level include problem-solving and coping skills, positive self-esteem, and a sense of purpose in life.\\\\nRelationship-level risks\\\\ninclude family conflict, knowing someone who died by suicide (particularly a family members), and social isolation; protective factors include family

Have you thought about harming yourself or others?\\\\nWhen talking about mental health problems:\\\\nKnow how to\\\\nconnect people to help\\\\nCommunicate in a straightforward manner\\\\nSpeak at a level appropriate to a person's age and development level (preschool children need fewer details as compared to teenagers)\\\\nDiscuss the topic when and where the person feels safe and comfortable\\\\nWatch for reactions during the discussion and slow down or back up if the person becomes confused or looks upset\\\\nSometimes it is helpful to make a comparison to a physical illness. For example, many people get sick with a cold or the flu, but only a few get really sick with something serious like pneumonia. People who have a cold are usually able to do their normal activities. However, if they get pneumonia, they will have to take medicine and may have to go to the hospital.\\\", 'watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult . on a very basic level , there exists a primal need to protect them from harm . the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older . at some point , there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts . children no longer need the basics ( food , shelter . water , safety ) as much as when they were toddlers , but rather , their needs shift to wanting more support , encouragement , advice , and room to make mistakes . this is where the ability to communicate with them , letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move , is so important . keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it .']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rag_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Effective interventions for children facing mental health issues include promoting healthy social and emotional development, recognizing warning signs, teaching positive behaviors and decision-making, encouraging helping others, ensuring access to school-based mental health supports, and developing effective school mental health programs.

It originates from unmet needs from childhood, trauma, or ongoing rejection from peers or family.
