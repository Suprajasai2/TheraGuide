Hospitalization may be needed during a severe episode to ensure a person’s safety, proper nutrition, sufficient sleep, and other factors.\nPeople with schizophrenia can experience:\nFalse beliefs that cannot be changed, even when presented facts (delusions).\nSeeing or hearing things that do not exist, such as a voice making commands (hallucinations).\nThe belief that others are reading or controlling their minds.\nDisorganized thinking and speech, including shifting from one thought to the next without a logical connection, or speaking in sentences that do not make sense to others.\nDifficulty speaking and expressing emotion, as well as problems with attention, memory, and organization.\nDisorganized or abnormal physical behavior, including inappropriately, repetitive, or\xa0excessive\xa0or strange actions, or a complete lack of movement or talking.\nA reduced ability to function normally, such as ignoring personal hygiene or not showing emotion.\nTreatment Options\nPeople with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment.

They don’t know what sights, sounds, and experiences are real or what they are imagining.\nWhat Is Schizophrenia?\nSchizophrenia usually involves delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that don’t exist), unusual physical behavior, and disorganized thinking and speech. It is common for people with schizophrenia to have paranoid thoughts or hear voices. For example, they may believe that someone is controlling their mind or going to cause them harm. These psychotic episodes are often frightening, confusing, and isolating.\nSchizophrenia can be extremely disruptive to a person’s life, making it hard to go to school or work, keep a schedule, socialize, complete daily tasks, or take care of oneself. However, with consistent treatment—a combination of medication, therapy, and social support—people with schizophrenia can manage the disease and lead fulfilling lives.\nWhat Causes Schizophrenia?\nNo one is sure what causes schizophrenia, but genetic makeup and brain chemistry likely play a role.

They may not know they are sick, or they may be ashamed of being labeled with a serious mental illness.\nSigns and Symptoms of Schizophrenia\nMillions of Americans suffer from schizophrenia, which usually starts between the ages of 16-30.

A common misconception is that individuals with eating disorders have a particular body habitus (e.g., individuals with anorexia nervosa are thin). However, eating disorders can affect anyone regardless of body size, race/ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. Many factors contribute to the development of an eating disorder, such as genes, hormones, co-morbid mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety disorders), social attitudes that promote very thin body types, and diet culture.\nAnorexia Nervosa\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder in which people avoid or severely restrict food.\nPeople with this disorder have an intense fear of weight gain. They may diet, exercise excessively, or compulsively use other methods (e.g., laxatives or diuretics) to lose weight.\nRisk factors for anorexia include:\nBeing overly concerned about weight and shape\nHaving an anxiety disorder or depression\nHaving a negative self-image\nHaving eating problems during infancy or early childhood\nInternalizing certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty\nTrying to be perfect or overly focused on rules\nSigns & Symptoms\nSymptoms of Anorexia Nervosa include:\nHaving an intense fear of gaining weight\nDenying the seriousness of food restriction\nFeeling a strong desire to be in control\nHaving a distorted sense of body image, and being very focused on body weight or shape', 'therapy does not work overnight , oftentimes it is a lifelong struggle , the therapists job is not to "" cure "" you or to remove something but rather to make you strong enough to live your life with your own peculiarities and struggles , remember we are human and constantly fallible . another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy , that is just a room , most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that room .', 'Denying the seriousness of food restriction\nFeeling a strong desire to be in control\nHaving a distorted sense of body image, and being very focused on body weight or shape\nPeople with anorexia may severely limit the amount of food they eat, or they may eat and then make themselves throw up. Other behaviors include:\nCutting food into small pieces or moving them around the plate instead of eating\nExercising all the time, even if they are hurt\nGoing to the bathroom right after meals\nRefusing to eat around other people\nUsing diet pills, laxatives, or diuretics\nOther symptoms of anorexia may include:\nConfused or slow thinking, along with poor memory or judgment\nDepression\nAnxiety\nDry mouth\nLoss of bone strength, muscle, and body fat\nFatigue\nBinge-Eating Disorder\nBinge eating disorder is when a person eats a much larger amount of food in a shorter period of time than they normally would.

The person then uses methods to prevent weight gain, such as vomiting, excessive exercise, or using laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills.\nThe affected person is usually aware that their eating pattern is abnormal and may feel fear or guilt when they binge and purge.\nSigns & Symptoms\nPeople with bulimia often eat large amounts of food, usually in secret. People can feel a lack of control over their eating during these episodes. Eating and binging episodes may occur as often as several times a day for many months or longer.']","Psychotherapy can aid recovery from eating disorders by providing a safe space to explore and address underlying emotional and psychological issues that contribute to the development of the disorder. A trained therapist can help individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and work towards developing a more positive body image. Additionally, psychotherapy can also help individuals develop skills to manage triggers and cravings, and learn how to maintain a healthy relationship with food and their body. "

depression or high anxiety , that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form ( addiction ) that would utilize this new behavior . another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens , a positive reward for a behavior , even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences . consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes , in this case sadness or depression , and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior ( such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist ) and working to extinguish the unwanted

What are the main symptoms of schizophrenia?,"Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and difficulty expressing emotions.",https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/schizophrenia,Mental Illness,"['Symptoms of schizophrenia vary from person to person and may change over time. Some people have one psychotic episode, while others experience many throughout their lives. When people first experience symptoms and episodes, they may not seek treatment for a variety of reasons— denial that they are sick; ashamed of being labeled with a serious mental illness; or do not realize they are showing signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. Hospitalization may be needed during a severe episode to ensure a person’s safety, proper nutrition, sufficient sleep, and other factors.\nPeople with schizophrenia can experience:\nFalse beliefs that cannot be changed, even when presented facts (delusions).\nSeeing or hearing things that do not exist, such as a voice making commands (hallucinations).\nThe belief that others are reading or controlling their minds.\nDisorganized thinking and speech, including shifting from one thought to the next without a logical connection, or speaking in sentences that do not make sense to others.\nDifficulty speaking and expressing emotion, as well as problems with attention, memory, and organization.\nDisorganized or abnormal physical behavior, including inappropriately, repetitive, or\xa0excessive\xa0or strange actions, or a complete lack of movement or talking.\nA reduced ability to function normally, such as ignoring personal hygiene or not showing emotion.\nTreatment Options\nPeople with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. But the earlier treatment begins, the better their chances for recovery and improved quality of life. Medication and therapy can help manage the symptoms of schizophrenia, and in many cases, people with schizophrenia can pursue their goals, have healthy relationships, keep jobs, and be productive members of their communities.\nMedication:', 'Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that causes people to interpret reality abnormally. They don’t know what sights, sounds, and experiences are real or what they are imagining.\nWhat Is Schizophrenia?\nSchizophrenia usually involves delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that don’t exist), unusual physical behavior, and disorganized thinking and speech. It is common for people with schizophrenia to have paranoid thoughts or hear voices. For example, they may believe that someone is controlling their mind or going to cause them harm. These psychotic episodes are often frightening, confusing, and isolating.\nSchizophrenia can be extremely disruptive to a person’s life, making it hard to go to school or work, keep a schedule, socialize, complete daily tasks, or take care of oneself. However, with consistent treatment—a combination of medication, therapy, and social support—people with schizophrenia can manage the disease and lead fulfilling lives.\nWhat Causes Schizophrenia?\nNo one is sure what causes schizophrenia, but genetic makeup and brain chemistry likely play a role. Millions of Americans suffer from schizophrenia, and when people first experience symptoms and episodes, they may not seek treatment for a variety of reasons. They may not know they are sick, or they may be ashamed of being labeled with a serious mental illness.\nSigns and Symptoms of Schizophrenia\nMillions of Americans suffer from schizophrenia, which usually starts between the ages of 16-30. In men, symptoms usually start in the late teens and early 20s, and in women start in the mid-20s to early 30s.', ""A Serious Mental Illness (SMI) is a mental illness that interferes with a person’s life and ability to function.

A psychiatrist may need to try different medications, at different doses, before finding the most effective medication with the least amount of side effects. It can take several weeks to notice an improvement in symptoms. For people who do not respond to medication, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an option. This brain stimulation technique passes small electric currents through the brain to ease the symptoms of schizophrenia.\nTherapy:\nIn addition to medication, therapy provides guidance and support to people with schizophrenia and their families:\nIndividual therapy (“talk therapy”)\nhelps people normalize thought patterns, notice early warning signs of relapse, and handle stress.\nFamily therapy\noffers support, insight, and awareness to families coping with schizophrenia.\nWhat You Can Do: Daily Habits Make a Difference\nOnce medication and therapy begin to work, these strategies can help ease the challenges of schizophrenia:\nStay focused on your treatment goals.\nTell family members or friends your goals so they can provide support.\nStick to your treatment plan.\nEven if symptoms lessen, it is important to go to therapy and take your medication as directed.

It is more common amongst women than men. A person who self-harms usually does not mean to kill themselves, but they are at higher risk of attempting suicide and dying by suicide if they do not get help.\nCauses\nSelf-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. Others do it more often and have trouble stopping.\nFor many people, self-harm gives them a sense of relief and is used as a means to cope with a problem. Some teens say that when they hurt themselves, they are trying to stop feeling lonely, angry, or hopeless.\nSigns & Symptoms\nExamples of self-harm include:\nCutting one’s skin with a sharp object\nPiercing the skin with sharp objects\nHitting or punching oneself or punching things (like a wall)\nBurning oneself with cigarettes, matches, or candles\nBreaking bones or bruising oneself\nSymptoms and warning signs of self-harm:\nScars\nWearing long sleeves or pants, even in hot weather\nTalking about feeling worthless or helpless\nFresh cuts, bruises, bite marks, or burns\nKeeping sharp objects on hand\nFrequent reports of accidental injury\nEmotional and behavioral instability and unpredictability\nGet Help\nIt is possible to overcome the urge to hurt yourself. There are other ways to find relief and cope with your emotions. Self-harm treatment options can include outpatient therapy, partial-inpatient or and inpatient hospitalization. When behaviors are life-threatening or interfere with daily life, specialized self-harm programs are recommended.\nLearn\nhow to talk about mental health\nto help you speak to a loved one who you may think is experiencing any mental health concerns.', 'hi . i \' m glad you wrote . in general , when a small thing bothers us ( and this happens to all of us ) , it \' s because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt "" too much "" or "" too intensely "" in the past , and we don \' t know how to manage that emotion effectively . . . we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible . cognitive behavioural therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively . you say that your behaviours are self destructive , and i agree . it sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards self - harm , and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem . this is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you . again , a good therapist can help you learn what \' s behind your shame and self - harm . your feelings are normal , and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help .', ""hi kansas , i feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here . feelings are never wrong , but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope . self - harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach . although i ' m glad you said something here , a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively . i hope you reach out to someone soon .""]","According to the text, overcoming self-harm tendencies involves addressing the underlying emotional and behavioral issues through therapies such as DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Enhanced screening, early intervention, and ongoing support can help mitigate these risks and improve overall well-being for Veterans.\nPeople Living in Rural Areas\nPeople living in rural areas face an elevated risk of suicide due to factors like social isolation, limited access to mental health care, and economic challenges. A focus on preventive measures including but not limited to increasing access to mental health services, fostering community connections, and promoting awareness about mental health issues is essential when addressing suicide prevention. Community support and outreach programs are critical to mitigating these risks.

Why is it important to address warning signs of depression early?,Early intervention can prevent worsening symptoms and help individuals manage their condition effectively.,https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/seasonal-affective-disorder,Depression,"['What Causes Depression?\nThere are a variety of causes of depression, including genetic, environmental, psychological, and biochemical factors.\nA person has an increased risk of depression if their family has a history of depression, they have experienced trauma, major life changes, stress, or certain physical illnesses (such as diabetes, cancer, or Parkinson’s), or as a side effect to certain medications.\nSigns and Symptoms of Depression\nDepression symptoms vary from person to person, and anyone who has questions about symptoms and signs should consult a doctor. To receive a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, some of these signs and symptoms must be present nearly every day for at least two weeks:\nContinued feelings of sadness, hopelessness, pessimism, emptiness\nFatigue, lack of energy\nInsomnia or other sleep issues, such as waking up very early or sleeping too much\nAnxiety, irritability, restlessness\nFeeling worthless or guilty\nLack of interest or joy in hobbies and activities\nChanges in appetite, leading to weight loss or weight gain\nMoving, talking, or thinking more slowly or feeling extra fidgety\nForgetfulness\nTrouble concentrating, thinking clearly, or making decisions\nThoughts of not wanting to live, death or suicide, suicide attempts, or self-harm behaviors\nDepression Treatment and Help\nLiving with depression can feel lonely. People may be fearful or ashamed of being labeled with a serious mental illness, causing them to suffer in silence, rather than get help. In fact, most people with major depression never seek the right treatment. But those struggling with this illness are not alone. It’s one of the most common and most treatable mental health disorders. With early, continuous treatment, people can gain control of their symptoms, feel better, and get back to enjoying their lives.', 'Similarly, feelings of sadness, anxiety, worry, irritability, or sleep problems are common for most people. However, when these feelings get very intense, last for a long period of time, and begin to interfere with school, work, and relationships, it may be a sign of a mental health problem. And just like people need to take medicine and get professional help for physical conditions, someone with a mental health problem may need to take medicine and/or participate in therapy to get better.', 'There are effective treatments for depression, including medications (such as antidepressants), along with talk therapy. Most people do best by using both. If standard treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies are also options that may be explored.\nTo be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. Some tests are used to rule out other serious medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Also, some central nervous system injuries and illnesses may also lead to depression.\nIn addition to clinical treatments, if you are one of the millions of people living with depression, there are also healthy lifestyle habits that can help you feel better:\nFocus on self-care.\nControl stress with activities such as meditation or tai chi. Eat healthy, exercise, and get enough sleep. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Avoid using alcohol and recreational drugs, which can worsen symptoms and make depression harder to treat.\nSet small, achievable goals.\nSet realistic goals to build confidence and motivation. A goal at the beginning of treatment may be to make your bed, have lunch with a friend, or take a walk. Build up to bigger goals as you feel better.\nKnow the warning signs.\nRecognize your depression triggers and talk to your doctor and/or mental health professional if you notice unusual changes in how you feel, think, or act. If needed, your doctor can safely adjust your medication. Write down how you feel day-to-day (moods, feelings, reactions) to spot patterns and understand your depression triggers.\nEducate family and friends about major depression.\nThey can help you notice warning signs that your depression may be returning.\nSeek support.\nWhether you find encouragement from family members or a support group, maintaining relationships with others is important, especially in times of crisis or rough spells.\nStick to your treatment plan.', 'Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.\nMental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

It is a serious mental illness that is more than just a feeling of being ""down in the dumps"" or ""blue"" for a few days.\nFor more than 20 million people in the United States who have depression, the feelings persist and can interfere with everyday life.\nTypes of Depression\nThe types of depression include:\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n, also known as clinical depression, is where people feel that a consistent dark mood is consuming them. It can inhibit daily functions and cause them to lose interest in activities which usually provide them pleasure.\nPersistent Depressive Disorder\nrefers to when a low mood lasts for two or more years in adults and at least one year in children an adolescents. A person with this disorder may experience episodes of major depressive disorder along with periods of less severe symptoms where they are typically able to function day-to-day.\nPostpartum Depression\naffects women after having a baby. It causes intense, long-lasting feelings of anxiety, sadness, and fatigue, making it difficult for mothers to care for themselves and/or their babies, as well as handle daily responsibilities. Postpartum depression can start anywhere from weeks to months after childbirth.\nPsychotic Depression\nis a form of depression with psychosis that comes when people get very depressed,\xa0such as delusions (false beliefs) and/or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there).\nSeasonal Affective Disorder\nis associated with\xa0changes in seasons. This form of depression usually occurs during the fall and winter months when there is less sunlight.\nBipolar Disorder\nis different than depression, but a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder can\xa0experience episodes of major depression.\nWhat Causes Depression?\nThere are a variety of causes of depression, including genetic, environmental, psychological, and biochemical factors.']","It is important to address warning signs of depression early because depression symptoms vary from person to person, and anyone who has questions about symptoms and signs should consult a doctor."
